DATA "This short weapon uses gauss technology not on a single round but on many flechettes, creating a rapid-firing shotgun effect when fired. Its small size makes it convenient on board ships and among vehicle crews, yet it retains a powerful short-ranged punch."

DATA "S","X","X","R","Light Assault Gun",8,800,7,0,4,4000,5,100,1,"Very Bulky"
DATA "This is a heavy 20 mm rifle, fed by a 5-round magazine. It is intended to be truly man-portable, delivering extremely hard-hitting power at squad-level, though its low rate of fire and small magazine mean its user must be adequately supported in a fire fight."

DATA "H","X","X","R","Light Gatling Laser",9,180,3,0,18,4500,100,300,2,"Auto 4","Zero-G"
DATA "An attempt to put together a multiple barrel laser system in a small package, the light gatling laser is low-powered compared to similar support weaponry but is capable of delivering a hail of fire. This alone can defeat or at least scare off lower Tech Level enemies, but it quickly runs out of steam against heavily armoured targets. However there is little in its class that matches it for price vs. performance."

DATA "H","X","X","R","VRF GAUSS GUN",12,750,4,0,250,20000,400,1000,2,"AP 5","Auto 8"
DATA "The very rapid-firing gauss gun is a support weapon that uses electromagnetic technology to deliver withering bursts of fire. Often used as an anti-personnel weapon on vehicles, consumption of ammunition is prodigious, and large hoppers have to be used to ensure adequate supply in combat. The VRF gauss gun may use the variant ammunition types found in the Ammunition chapter of the Central Supply Catalogue."
